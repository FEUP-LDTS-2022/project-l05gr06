# LDTS_l05gr06 - TETRIS RUNNER

### Game Description

In this new exciting version of a game we all are familiar with - tetris - there's a vast sea of fun ways to play it.
The game is basically the tetris everyone knows, but there's a little man - Jacob - down there, where the shapes fall, trying to avoid them.

This makes it so there's a lot of options for the users - let's call the user controlling the shapes player1 and the one controlling 
Jacob player2- to choose:

- **"Classic"** - While player1 is playing normal tetris, player2 is collecting floating coins while avoiding the falling shapes;
- **Climbing** - The speedrun variant. Player1 needs to get player2 up top as fast as possible;
- **1v1** - Player1 is purposefully trying to make player2 loose. He has 1 minute to do it.

Note that the game doesn't need to be multiplayer, with the right coordination it is possible for someone to control both the shapes
and Jacob. The only game mode exclusively multiplayer is 1v1.
